# covid-political-speech
This repo contains the code used for my Capstone project for my Master's degree in Applied Social Data Science from the London School of Economics and Political Science. 

The first 4 scripts in this repository borrow from Evan Odell and his Hansard Speeches project. Documentation for this project lives on his website here: https://evanodell.com/projects/datasets/hansard-data/ and he is kind enough to share his code in a repository here: https://github.com/evanodell/hansard-data3. 

Script 6 trains and assesses a series of machine learning classifiers on Parliamentary speech data. Script 7 creates a variety of visualizations both to be included in the report and for help understanding the data. Script 8 brings Google mobility data into the fold, mapping mobility data to the speeches data and doing analysis on the relationship between the two.
