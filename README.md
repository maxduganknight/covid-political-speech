# covid-political-speech
Very much a work in progress, this project is for the purpose analysing and modelling UK Parliamentary speech on COVID-19 restrictions.

The code in this repository borrows heavily from Evan Odell and his Hansard Speeches project: https://evanodell.com/projects/datasets/hansard-data/.
