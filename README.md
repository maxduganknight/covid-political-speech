# covid-political-speech
This project is for the purpose of analysing and modelling UK Parliamentary speech on COVID-19 restrictions.

The first 4 scripts in this repository borrow from Evan Odell and his Hansard Speeches project. Documentation for this project lives on his website here: https://evanodell.com/projects/datasets/hansard-data/ and he is kind enough to share his code in a repository here: https://github.com/evanodell/hansard-data3.
